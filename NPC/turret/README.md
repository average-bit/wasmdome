# Turret Mech

This turret is designed to stay in the location in which it was spawned. It will request a radar scan every turn. If it has a successful radar scan available, it will pick the first _enemy_ target from that scan and fire in that enemy's direction with its primary weapon. This effectively means the turret could fire its primary weapon once per turn throughout the entire match.
